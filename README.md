I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major. My hobbies include programming, videogames, cosplay, art,
and game development. Currently, I'm interning part-time for Northrop Grummand and I also 
participate in Hack4Impact at Cal Poly. I look forward to this course and learning more about low level programming.
